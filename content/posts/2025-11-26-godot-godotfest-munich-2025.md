## Overview

You fancy curry wurst, beer and Godot? There was a perfect opportunity to bring all these nice things together last week as there was [GodotFest 2025](https://godotfest.com/) - a conference dedicated to Godot Engine filled with open-source enthusiasts and game developers 🎮

We survived the journey, and we want to share a few interesting things we thought were worth sharing. No pretzels to share anyway! 🥨

## Team Insights

### Jakub Hubáček

**One Key Insight:**

What we see most of the time is Godot in the hands of indie devs creating amazing small games. This is slowly changing, and skillful teams of game developers are starting to use Godot Engine to build their own tools. Among many there is Epictellers, an experienced team that came up with a high-quality narrative and level design tool that supports quite a lot in their development process.

**Favorite Presentation:**

### Jan Mesarč

**One Key Insight:**

GodotFest 2025 was an amazing experience for me. It was not only a chance to reconnect with old friends but also to make many new ones. We all share a love for Godot, and that sense of community was everywhere. The conference was professional, the venue was a perfect fit, and the talks were outstanding. It's hard to pick just one highlight, but if I must, my choice is René Habermann's talk: Don't Ship the Wrong Game! It really stood out to me because it reminded me how crucial it is to stay aligned with the core vision of a project and avoid feature creep or misdirection. This insight will definitely influence how I approach future game development decisions.

**Favorite Presentation:**

### Tomáš Bubeníček

**One Key Insight:**

The best talks are the ones where the presentation itself is in the Godot Engine 😉 RAWRLAB Games' presentation about Switch publishing (not recorded) and Perfoon's presentation about the usage of 2D SDF generated in runtime by Godot were the highlights for me.

**Favorite Presentation:**

## Conclusion

This year, [GodotFest 2025](https://godotfest.com/) took the place of GodotCon, though this was a one-time exception. Going forward, GodotFest will establish Munich as its permanent home, while GodotCon will continue to rotate among different European cities.

All videos from GodotFest are available in the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCCIq-5mpJSIiW4cgb2P5OBwF5JM9P47p).
